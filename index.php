		<h1>Hi, I'm Joey.</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Professional</h2>
		<p>I love technology. I'm currently working part-time at Best Buy selling computers.
			I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Marketing from the University of New Mexico and a Master's in Business Administration from the University of Phoenix. I have experience in marketing, graphic design, sales and overall bad assery.
			<br>
			I like to tinker. I recently built a pretty bad ass home theater PC and have been spending a lot of time configuring that. A couple of projects I want to start soon are: 1) Building a RetroPie, 2) Re-building my gaming computer, and 3) Building a FreeNAS Storage Server.

		<br>
		<h2>Personal</h2>
		<p>People tell me that I look like Abbot from Abbot & Costello.</p>

		<p>I have also gotten Yakko from the Animaniacs.</p>

		<p>I've lived in Albuquerque for about 20 years. Not wifed up yet, but I have two dogs that like to cuddle so that will suffice for now. I like to play volleyball and softball to stay active and for fun.</p>
